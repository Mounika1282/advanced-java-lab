AIM: 
To learn the basic concepts and features of Advanced Java for building web and 
enterprise applications. 
1. What are the differences between Core Java and Advanced Java? 
CORE JAVA ADVANCED JAVA 
Core Java covers the basics of the Java 
Programming 
Language with essential libraries and functions. 
Advanced Java deals topics beyond Core Java, 
focusing on web and enterprise applications. 
It includes basic concepts like OOP principles, 
syntax, data types, and standard libraries. 
It involves in understanding advanced 
frameworks and also the technologies used in 
large applications. 
Core Java includes basic libraries like java.lang, 
java.io, java.math, java.util 
Advanced Java adds more libraries and APIs, 
such as JDBC, JSP, Servlets, and EJB. 
 
2. What are the main important features of Applets in Java? 
Applets run in a sandboxed environment, which restricts their access to system resources such as 
memory, processing power, and storage. Applets typically provide limited user interaction, usually 
through HTML controls or UI components provided by the applet itself. 
 
3. What are the key features of Java Servlets? 
• Servlets work on the server side. 
• Servlets are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the web server. 
• Generate dynamic responses efficiently. 
 
4. What are the differences between Applets and Servlets in Java?  
APPLETS SERVLETS 
Applets are executed on clientside  Servlets are executed on server- side  
The parent package includes java.awt.* and  
java.applet.*  
The parent package of Servlet includes 
java.servlet.http.* and  
javax.servlet.*  
For the execution of the applet, a user interface 
is required such as AWT or swing.  
No such interface is required for the execution 
of the servlet.  
Applets are more prone to risk as execution is 
on the client machine.  
Servlets are more secure as execution is under 
server security.  
 
5. What are the major features of Java compared to other programming languages? 
• Java offers higher cross-functionality and portability as programs written in one platform can 
run across desktops, mobiles, embedded systems.

• Java is free, simple, object-oriented, distributed, supports multithreading, and offers 
multimedia and network support. 
• Java is a mature language, therefore more stable and predictable. The Java Class Library 
enables cross-platform development. 
 
6. What is the main role of JDBC and ODBC in database connectivity? 
JDBC is Java-specific and designed for Java applications to connect with relational databases. 
ODBC is language-independent and enables applications in various languages to connect with 
databases seamlessly. 
7. What are the differences between ODBC and JDBC?  
ODBC JDBC 
ODBC Stands for Open Database Connectivity.  JDBC Stands for Java database connectivity.  
Introduced by Microsoft in 1992.  Introduced by SUN Micro Systems in 1997.  
We can choose ODBC only Windows platform.  We can use JDBC on any platform.  
ODBC is procedural JDBC is object-oriented 
 
8. What are the differences between Cookies and Sessions in web applications? 
COOKIES SESSIONS 
Stored on the client side  Stored on the server side.  
Less secure, as it is exposed to the client.  More secure, as data is stored on the server.  
Faster as data is stored on the client.  Slightly slower as each request requires server 
processing.  
Examples: Google, Facebook, Amazon, 
YouTube, Netflix etc.  
Examples: Banking Websites, E-learning 
Platforms etc.  
 
9. What are the differences between Spring Boot and the traditional Spring Framework?  
SPRING SPRING BOOT 
Spring is an open-source lightweight 
framework widely used to develop enterprise 
applications.  
Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional 
spring framework, widely used to develop 
REST APIs.  
The most important feature of the Spring 
Framework is dependency injection.  
The most important feature of the Spring Boot 
is  
Auto configuration.  
It helps to create a loosely coupled application.  It helps to create a stand-alone application.  
 
10. What are the differences between standalone applications and web applications?  
STANDALONE WEB 
It can be used offline, which is ideal for 
intermittent internet  
access  
Requires a constant internet connection, 
enabling real-time  
collaboration  
Requires installation on the user's device  Accessed through a browser, eliminating the 
need for  
installation  
 
 
 
11. What are the basic requirements for executing a web application? 
• User Management 
• Security 
• Authentication 
• Data Requirements
